This project has been created for one of the leading companies of Uzbekistan called "Oqtepa LAvash".But one thing which should be taken into consideration is to know that this project has only been made for the Coursework of WebTechnology Module.I tried to make a six-page website containing pages from Home to Payment.At maximum level , i Utilized JavaScript for Payment page whenever you write your personal information for a plastic card,the card will show you your personal data interestingly.Moreover, I also attemted to make some remarkable developments to this projectsuch as improvements in payment method in the attractiveness and interactivity of the pages.It was also one of the most indespensable experiences to learn some new things which have not been covered in our module.Last but not least, during completing this assignment i realized that i have learned how to solve issues related to CSS HTML AND JAVASCRIPT to a large extent. I admit that i also made some mistakes which will be corrected in the future
